When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When either working between several machines as a single user or as
    a collaboration effort with peers over a distributed network.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This might cause constant conflicts with other people editing the data.
    Allows for more flexibility of use.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones are a true copy of a repo. It can be locally or distributed (via GitHub)
    Branches are splits from the master branch. Allowing safe changes whilst keeping stable code on master.
    Forks are GitHub clone operation which links back to the original author. Don't be a dick.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can test for changes made to the Git repo wrt to your repo.
